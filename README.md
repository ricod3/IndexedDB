# Small Web Application for a showcase of CRUD Operations in IndexedDB

This web application was developed as part of the Coders.Bay training program in Linz. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on programming languages. The data is stored in the browser's IndexedDB and displayed on the webpage.

## Features

- **Add a Programming Language**: Users can add a new programming language by entering the name and description of the language.
- **Update a Programming Language**: Users can update the details of an existing programming language by entering the ID of the language.
- **Delete a Programming Language**: Users can delete a programming language by entering the ID of the language.
- **View All Programming Languages**: Users can view all the programming languages that have been added.
